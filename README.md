### About me 👨‍🎓

- I am an M.Sc. Student in Methodology and Statistics at Utrecht University, The Netherlands.
- My research interests are Bayesian inference, structural equation modeling, hypothesis testing, and metascience.
- What made me special is not myself. Instead, all the awesome people around me including, but not limited to, advisors, teachers, classmates, and my students made me meaningful. **I appreciate all of you who influenced me. Thank you, all.**
